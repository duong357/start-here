Start here if you are new to my GitHub

Thanks for visitng my GitHub!

As of this writing, I am reorganizing my code offline and dealing with GitHub's new authentication scheme.
GitHub will transition from password to token authentication throughout 2021 as described here
(https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/)

I expect to add new repositories in the coming days.
